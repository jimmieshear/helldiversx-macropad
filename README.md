# helldiversx-macropad
Macro setup for my Adafruit Macropad for use with Helldivers2 

This is based on the excellent work done by squid_jpg and the hard work by Phillip Burgess.

I've added a constants file to create a easier way of defining and using them in the actual macros 
files themselves. 
This keeps things relatively organized by type, as well as default colors. Creating a new macro is as easy as
adding the name of stratagem you want.
